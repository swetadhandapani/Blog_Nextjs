**Mini Blog Using Next.js -- Project Overview**

The **Mini Blog using Next.js** is a dynamic, modern web application
designed to demonstrate core features of Next.js, including server-side
rendering, API routing, and seamless integration with a NoSQL database
like MongoDB. This project is perfect for showcasing the capabilities of
Next.js and creating a fully functional, lightweight blogging platform.

**Features and Functionality**

1.  **Dynamic Blog Post Listings**\
    The home page displays a list of blog posts fetched dynamically from
    a backend API. Each post is shown with a title, description snippet,
    and a link to view detailed information. Pagination or infinite
    scrolling can also be implemented to enhance usability.

2.  **Individual Post Details**\
    Each blog post has its dedicated details page, accessed through
    dynamic routing. This page displays the post title, content, an
    image, and metadata such as the publication date. The information is
    fetched from the backend based on the unique ID of the post.

3.  **Responsive Design**\
    Built with modern CSS frameworks like Tailwind CSS, the application
    ensures a responsive layout that works seamlessly across devices.
    The clean and minimalist design prioritizes user experience.

4.  **API Integration**\
    The project features a backend API for managing blog posts and user
    inquiries:

    -   **Get all posts**: Fetch a list of blog posts.

    -   **Get post by ID**: Fetch detailed information for a specific
        post.

    -   **Contact form submission**: Capture and process user inquiries
        via a dedicated API endpoint.

5.  **MongoDB Integration**\
    MongoDB is used as the primary database for storing blog post data
    and contact form submissions. The application demonstrates
    connecting to the database, defining a schema using Mongoose, and
    performing CRUD operations.

6.  **SEO and Metadata Management**\
    The project utilizes Next.js metadata features to dynamically update
    page titles and meta descriptions based on the content being
    displayed. This improves search engine visibility and enhances user
    experience.
